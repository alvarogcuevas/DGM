For this document  study the simulation of a process $X(t)$ as described in [@mcsweeney2014stochastically]. Such process is a jump-diffusion solving the following stochastic differential equation:

$$X(t)=b(X(t))dt+\sqrt{\varepsilon}\sigma(X(t))dW(t)+\int_{\mathcal{M}}\varepsilon\gamma(X(t-),Y(t))dN_k(t)$$
where $W(t)$ is a Brownian Motion and $N(t)$ is a marked point process with intensity measure $\Lambda(X(t))\nu(dy)$.

For reproductibility purposes we will consider the same structure as Example 3.3 in [@mcsweeney2014stochastically] and specifically the constants used to generate Figure 1 (page 1251), i.e.,

$$b(x)=-x + (1- x)-(16/3)(1-x)x+(32/3)x^2(1-x)$$

$$\sigma(x)=\sqrt(x(1-x))$$

Further, the jump intensity is $\Lambda(X(t))=(1/2)\varepsilon^2N^2$ for fied constants $\varepsilon^2=0.02$ and $N=1500$. In order to model the birth-death splitting, the jump size distribution is uniform taking values in the set $\mathcal{M}=\{-1,1\}$.
